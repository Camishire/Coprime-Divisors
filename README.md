# Coprime-Divisors
Given two integers p and q. Find all divisors of the number p that are coprime to another number q. Two numbers are called coprime if their greatest common divisor is 1.

Input :
Two integers p and q (1 < p,q < 10^9).

Output :
Output the divisors found in ascending order. If there are no divisors that satisfy the condition, output 0.
